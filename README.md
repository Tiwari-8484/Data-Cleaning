# 🚀 Data Cleaning & Analysis in Excel – Boosting A-Mart’s Profitability! 🚀
Today, I worked on a large sales dataset (14K rows) of A-Mart, focusing on data cleaning and insightful analysis using Excel to extract meaningful business insights.

#🔍 Key Insights Uncovered:

## ✅ Top 3 States by Sales Amount:

📌 Bihar – ₹3,25,214

📌 Madhya Pradesh (MP) – ₹3,19,233

📌 Haryana – ₹2,83,574

## ✅ State-wise total revenue calculated to help identify high-performing and underperforming regions.
##✅ Analyzed products with less than 3 months of shelf life to optimize inventory, reduce wastage, and increase profitability.

# 📈 Business Impact:

## 🔹 By focusing on high-revenue states, A-Mart can boost sales further through targeted marketing.
## 🔹 Near-expiry product analysis ensures timely discounts or promotions to minimize losses & maximize profits.
